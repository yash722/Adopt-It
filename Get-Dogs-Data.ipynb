'https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/themes/mspca-theme/images/noimg.png'], 'Description': [' If you haven’t yet met Wendy– you’re missing out! Ms. Wendy is a 5 year old pitbull great dane mix who is our resident social butterfly at the Methuen shelter! Wendy loves all people and has been doing a GREAT job practicing her best manners. Wendy is housebroken, polite, and smart and is looking for a cozy spot to call home. Since Wendy is a big lady, she is looking for adopters who are willing and ready to continue her training. Wendy has been doing great with her positive reinforcement training since arriving to the shelter. During her stay, she’s been working on walking on a loose leash on a harness, disengaging from other animals in the environment (as she has a strong desire for rabbits (; ), and mastering some other special cues like “sit” “lay down” and “drop it”. Wendy also loves to bounce around a yard space with her volunteer friends and entertain herself with some lowkey play time. After Wendy’s had the chance to get some of her energy out, she is also a master snuggler, and is sure to win your heart over if you meet her! While Wendy has been able to successfully navigate a world with lots of dogs, she would likely do best as the only dog in the home. She has the potential to live with another dog, however it would require much more management and that dog would need to be more tolerant of her big and bossy playstyle. Wendy has a high prey drive so unfortuntely she isn’t a candidate to live with a cat or other small mammal. Wendy has the potential to live with kids, however she is a big gal still working on her manners, so bigger teens may be best! If you are interested in Wendy, please stop by our Methuen Adoption Center between the hours of 12PM-3PM Tuesday-Sunday!', ' Rilee is a happy girl that loves to give kisses to\\nher favorite people and now that she`s comfortable, she wiggles her way through the halls of the shelter to say hi to everyone she meets. She loves to entertain her friends with her silly antics when she`s playing with toys. This good girl is house and crate trained! Because Rilee has been through many changes in a short time, her adopters should plan on giving her plenty of time with just household members before slowly expanding her world. This time gives her an opportunity to bond with her family, while they learn what makes her comfortable. She has not had much experience meeting new dogs and while she may eventually be able to have a walking buddy, she is not a candidate for daycare or dog parks. Rilee would likely be most comfortable as the only dog in the home and politely declines the company of cats. Any kids in the family must be older and have previous dog experience. To learn about this pretty pittie lady, stop by the shelter during open hours to talk to staff.\\nTuesday-Sunday 12-3p', ' This happy guy is as smart as he is handsome! He knows sit, down, and speak, and walks nicely on the leash. Georgie seems to enjoy the company of humans more than canine friends, and we think he would do best as the only dog in the home. He loves working on his tricks, playing with toys, and getting pets from his people. Honestly, we think you`d be hard pressed to find a dog with a bigger smile than this guy, when he`s with his humans. Georgie is 7 years old and has had a few transitions in a short period of time, so adopters should plan on giving him plenty of time to settle in with just household members. This will help this good boy bond with his new family while everyone gets acquainted. Any kids in the family should be old enough to respect his needs as he adjusts to his new home. If you are looking for a great walking and cuddling partner, Georgie is your man! He is a volunteer favorite! Come and meet him today! Open hours at our Cape location are Tuesday-Sunday 1-4pm.\\nWeight – 69.45 lbs', ' Smart, sweet and cute are all fitting words to describe Ms. Skylar! Skylar is a one year old pitbull mix ready to find her home! While Skylar is happy to lay down and entertain herself with some stuffy toys, she is also a young active dog who is ready to bring the party! Skylar is looking for adopters who are willing to put a little extra effort getting her started with some of the basics a young dog may require like training, settling into a new space, and navigating the world, and will benefit from people willing to keep her world small to start. Adopters should be prepared for Skylar to show her more active side as she gets comfortable and settles in. While Skylar is likely capable of having some well-matched dog friends, another dog in the home would need to be accepting of a high energy young dog who can be a bit awkward. At this time, Skylar is not looking to live with cats or younger kids. If Skylar sounds like a match for you, feel free to stop by our Methuen Adoption Center between the hours of 12PM-3PM Tuesday-Sunday!', ' Handsome, energetic, and fun, thats our boy Ace! Ace is a 1 year old pitbull terrier looking for his future home! While Ace is excited about life and a happy-go-lucky guy with his friends, he can be a bit worried to start so adopters should be ready to give this guy a quiet spot to transition home. Additionally, Ace is quite an active guy so he`s looking for adopters ready to keep him both mentally and physically stimulated! While Ace loves dogs, his ideal roommate would be a well-mannered adult dog who could show him the ropes! At this time, Ace isn not looking to live with cats or kids. If Ace sounds like the guy for you, please visit our Methuen Adoption Center Tuesday-Sunday 12PM-3PM!', ' Meet young puppy Joule! Joule is happy, bouncy, and full of life! Joule loves her friends over at the shelter and has been our latest little puppy project. Thus far in our care, Joule is working hard at practicing her polite greetings, comfortably navigating the world on leash, and using her little puppy mouth in appropriate ways all by the means of force-free, positively reinforced interactions. We are looking for adopters willing to take on this little lady who will require a bit more support than your average puppy while she continues to learn the ropes of life! Joule is a bit worried about dogs, and would prefer to be the only pup in the home. Joule has a history of living with a cat that she was pretty interested in playing with, so any cats involved in her life should be dog-savvy, and comfortable with a high-energy pup! Joule is looking to join a home with adults only at this time to best set her on the track to continue practicing being her best self in a lower traffic home. If our smart cookie Joule sounds like the pup for you, please head to the Methuen MSPCA location Tuesday-Sunday between the hours of 12PM-3PM!', ' Nala is large and in charge, and is ready to join her new home! She has a sweet personality and enjoys spending time with her people. She also has a playful side to show off when she is comfortable! Nala has let us know that she needs all the attention to herself, so she will likely prefer to be the only pet in the home for now, but could live with children in the home with plenty of supervision. If you think you are a good fit and would like to learn more, stop by our Boston Adoption Center. We have open adoption hours Tuesday-Sunday from 12pm-3pm no appointment needed to speak to a staff person regarding available dogs.\\nFor more information on our adoption process, please visit https://www.mspca.org/adoption-centers/how-to-adopt/ Please note, in an effort to keep the stress levels reduced for the dogs in our care, our dog kennel areas will not be open to walk through.

Daisy was transported from the south and looks like a Catahoula mix, but what she’s mixed with is a mystery! Daisy is silly and playful, and is looking for help learning all of the things puppies do. She is still learning that it is not polite to jump on people or use her mouth while playing, so she would do best in a home with patient adopters who are able to spend time training Daisy and meeting her needs. Daisy would do best with teens that can participate in training. She could do well with a dog who is ok with puppy energy or a cat with slow introductions.

This 2 year old bowling ball is a class clown – sometimes seemingly not in control of his limbs, he can be a bit on the mischevious (but not very sneaky) side!

Daryl was brought to us through our relocation program, so we don’t have too much history as to what his life was like prior to him coming to our shelter. However, he has spent a short period of time in a home setting where we learned he has some of the makings of house-training, and he loves to entertain himself with toys! As you might guess from his picture, Daryl is going to be a high energy dog who will require lots of work on basic manners and leash walking skills, so adopters should be ready (and excited!) for a dog that will require lots of mental and physical activity, in addition to some training. Daryl has the potential to join a home with a similarly matched dog friend, but will likely require a slow-introduction to start! Daryl is not looking for a home with cats or kids at this time as he’s still working on mastering being his best good-boy self.
