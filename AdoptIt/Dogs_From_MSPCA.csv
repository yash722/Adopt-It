Wendy,Great Dane / Pit Bull Terrier,Nevins Farm,Female,5 Years,88.18,https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wendy.jpg?1700198752," If you haven’t yet met Wendy– you’re missing out! Ms. Wendy is a 5 year old pitbull great dane mix who is our resident social butterfly at the Methuen shelter! Wendy loves all people and has been doing a GREAT job practicing her best manners. Wendy is housebroken, polite, and smart and is looking for a cozy spot to call home. Since Wendy is a big lady, she is looking for adopters who are willing and ready to continue her training. Wendy has been doing great with her positive reinforcement training since arriving to the shelter. During her stay, she’s been working on walking on a loose leash on a harness, disengaging from other animals in the environment (as she has a strong desire for rabbits (; ), and mastering some other special cues like “sit” “lay down” and “drop it”. Wendy also loves to bounce around a yard space with her volunteer friends and entertain herself with some lowkey play time. After Wendy’s had the chance to get some of her energy out, she is also a master snuggler, and is sure to win your heart over if you meet her! While Wendy has been able to successfully navigate a world with lots of dogs, she would likely do best as the only dog in the home. She has the potential to live with another dog, however it would require much more management and that dog would need to be more tolerant of her big and bossy playstyle. Wendy has a high prey drive so unfortuntely she isn’t a candidate to live with a cat or other small mammal. Wendy has the potential to live with kids, however she is a big gal still working on her manners, so bigger teens may be best! If you are interested in Wendy, please stop by our Methuen Adoption Center between the hours of 12PM-3PM Tuesday-Sunday!"
Rilee,Pit Bull Terrier,Nevins Farm,Female,7 Years,68.12,https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rilee1-1-1024x1024.jpg?1700198760," Rilee is a happy girl that loves to give kisses to
her favorite people and now that she`s comfortable, she wiggles her way through the halls of the shelter to say hi to everyone she meets. She loves to entertain her friends with her silly antics when she`s playing with toys. This good girl is house and crate trained! Because Rilee has been through many changes in a short time, her adopters should plan on giving her plenty of time with just household members before slowly expanding her world. This time gives her an opportunity to bond with her family, while they learn what makes her comfortable. She has not had much experience meeting new dogs and while she may eventually be able to have a walking buddy, she is not a candidate for daycare or dog parks. Rilee would likely be most comfortable as the only dog in the home and politely declines the company of cats. Any kids in the family must be older and have previous dog experience. To learn about this pretty pittie lady, stop by the shelter during open hours to talk to staff.

Georgie,Labrador Retriever Mix,Cape Cod,Male,8 Years,69.45,https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-3.jpeg?1700198771," This happy guy is as smart as he is handsome! He knows sit, down, and speak, and walks nicely on the leash. Georgie seems to enjoy the company of humans more than canine friends, and we think he would do best as the only dog in the home. He loves working on his tricks, playing with toys, and getting pets from his people. Honestly, we think you`d be hard pressed to find a dog with a bigger smile than this guy, when he`s with his humans. Georgie is 7 years old and has had a few transitions in a short period of time, so adopters should plan on giving him plenty of time to settle in with just household members. This will help this good boy bond with his new family while everyone gets acquainted. Any kids in the family should be old enough to respect his needs as he adjusts to his new home. If you are looking for a great walking and cuddling partner, Georgie is your man! He is a volunteer favorite! Come and meet him today! Open hours at our Cape location are Tuesday-Sunday 1-4pm.

Skylar is a one year old pitbull mix ready to find her home!

Skylar is looking for adopters who are willing to put a little extra effort getting her started with some of the basics a young dog may require like training, settling into a new space, and navigating the world, and will benefit from people willing to keep her world small to start. Adopters should be prepared for Skylar to show her more active side as she gets comfortable and settles in. While Skylar is likely capable of having some well-matched dog friends, another dog in the home would need to be accepting of a high energy young dog who can be a bit awkward. At this time, Skylar is not looking to live with cats or younger kids.

We are looking for adopters willing to take on this little lady who will require a bit more support than your average puppy while she continues to learn the ropes of life! Joule is a bit worried about dogs, and would prefer to be the only pup in the home. Joule has a history of living with a cat that she was pretty interested in playing with, so any cats involved in her life should be dog-savvy, and comfortable with a high-energy pup!

She has a sweet personality and enjoys spending time with her people. She also has a playful side to show off when she is comfortable!

However, he has spent a short period of time in a home setting where we learned he has some of the makings of house-training, and he loves to entertain himself with toys! As you might guess from his picture, Daryl is going to be a high energy dog who will require lots of work on basic manners and leash walking skills, so adopters should be ready (and excited!) for a dog that will require lots of mental and physical activity, in addition to some training. Daryl has the potential to join a home with a similarly matched dog friend, but will likely require a slow-introduction to start! Daryl is not looking for a home with cats or kids at this time as he’s still working on mastering being his best good-boy self.

Ellie,Rat Terrier Mix,Nevins Farm,Female,3 Years,31.75,https://www.mspca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-46.jpeg?1700199026," Ellie is a 3 year old dog brought to us through our relocation program! While we don’t have much knowledge on Ellie prior to her being in our care, our adoption center staff is happy to chat through all of the great things we have learned about her thus far! Ellie is a real sweetheart, and has really enjoyed her time spent around her new human friends here. She is friendly and kind, and is a pro at loose leash walking! Ellie is looking for adopters willing to have some patience to get her settled into her new home, as we don’t know that shes learned any of the basics an adult dog like her would have learned just yet like house training, crate training, basic manners in the home, etc. In the shelter, Ellie has done really great at meeting other dogs on leash and has the potential to live with a similar lowkey dog friend. While she doesn’t have a history with cats, she could potentially live with a dog-savvy cat with a slow-introduction. Again, Ellie LOVES people and could potentially live with kids, but adopters should be committed to making sure all interactions are well managed and supervised to help best set everyone up for success! If wonderful Ellie sounds like the one for you, stop by our Methuen Adoption Center 12PM-3PM Tuesday-Sunday."

Patsy is not a fan of feline friends, and her comfort level with other dogs varies, as she tends to prefer the company of certain canine companions. Leash skills are a work in progress for Patsy, so a family committed to helping her build confidence in this area would be ideal. Additionally, she is still learning the ropes of potty training and would benefit greatly from a supportive and consistent environment. With time, love, and gentle guidance, Patsy is sure to transform into a loyal and devoted companion, ready to bring joy to her new home."

Meet Doug, an adorable 6-month-old black lab puppy who’s ready to find his forever home. Doug may be young, but he has a unique personality that requires special attention, care, and love. Let’s dive into what makes Doug such a special addition to your family. Decompression Needed:
Doug has had a bit of a rough start in life, and he may need some time to adjust to his new surroundings. If you’re patient and understanding, you’ll see him blossom into the wonderful pup he is meant to be. Allow him the time and space he needs to decompress and get comfortable in his new home. Fearful/Sensitive to Changes in Environment:
Doug is a sensitive soul who gets easily overwhelmed by changes in his environment. Loud noises, unfamiliar places, and sudden movements can make him anxious. With your support, he can build confidence over time. A calm, consistent environment will help him feel safe and secure. Socialization Required:
Doug didn’t have the opportunity for proper socialization in his early months. As a result, he may be a bit shy around new people, dogs, and experiences. It’s important to slowly introduce him to different situations, other dogs, and people in a positive and controlled manner. Socialization classes and gentle exposure will help him grow into a well-adjusted, happy pup. General Handling Required:
Like any puppy, Doug is still learning about the world. He’ll need guidance and gentle handling to build his trust and confidence. This is an opportunity for you to be his loving teacher, helping him grow into a well-mannered and loving companion. What Doug Needs: A patient and understanding owner who is willing to give him the time to adjust.
A quiet and stable home environment where he can feel secure.
Positive and gradual socialization with other dogs and people.
Consistent training and lots of love and affection.
In return, Doug promises to be your loyal and loving companion, always eager to learn and share his love with you. His boundless energy and zest for life will bring joy to your days. If you are up for the rewarding journey of helping Doug overcome his challenges and watching him thrive, please consider opening your heart and home to this wonderful black lab. Together, you and Doug can create a lifetime of cherished memories and unbreakable bonds."
